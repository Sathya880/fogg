            <h1>The Story Of Fogg!</h1>
            <p>The man behind Vini Cosmetics is Mr. Darshan Patel (CEO & Founder) . Mr. Patel is known for his keenness to understand consumer behavior thoroughly before marketing his products. He is also the man behind Paras Pharma – the company which owns Moov, Itch Guard and Krack.</p>
            <p>Vini started its journey by launching 18+ Deo in 2009. It was a huge flop. This led Mr. Patel to do a market research and identify a gap. His market research agency Ormax, with whom he had worked for 25 years, surveyed over 1,000 respondents in the eight most populous cities of India. As predicted by Mr. Patel, consumers showed no loyalty towards a particular brand but complained that their deodorant cans got over very fast. This is where he thought of marketing Fogg not on basis of smell but on the basis of longevity.</p>
            <p>Before Fogg entered the market, Axe enjoyed the market share in India’s deodorant industry followed by Set Wet, Park Avenue, Wild Stone. All these mentioned players used similar positioning strategy: How use of deodorant can attract or lure females towards you. This was the industry wide practice – to position on the basis of emotional benefits. Also, fogg’s simple insight was all the body sprays contains gas.</p>

            <p>This is where Fogg entered talking not about emotional benefits but about functional benefits. They positioned themselves as ‘Bina Gas Vala Body Spray’. They even claimed 800 sprays in a 100 gm bottle which nobody could ever think of.</p>
            <p>“Fogg did Rs 100 crore of sales in 2012, a year since its launch, and ever since has been growing at 30-40% YoY.</p>
